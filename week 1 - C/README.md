This is the Week 1 of the course CS50 by Harvard.

This is a very basic understanding of how C works and some basic syntax for the language.

A decent amount of what this week covers is more so understanding what code can do and basic arithmetic functions as well.

This is fairly simple in terms of understanding but it's good to know and read through to make sure you are up to date with the syntax and how it works at a very basic level.

There are a few things that happen in this week, here is a following list of things you will find in this week's files - 

Hello.c - this is the first code file that has been created, a basic hello world and hello (name).
Compare.c - this is the second code that has been written that takes a look at basic arithmetic functions.
Agree.c - the first look at "and" "or" arguments in C
Cat.c - the first look at using loops

A few other things are talked about in the link itself and ive also created notes and then restructured it all with chatgpt to make them more in depth as well, all organized into a pdf to create ease of use and view.
